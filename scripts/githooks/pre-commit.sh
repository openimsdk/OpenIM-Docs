# This is a pre-commit hook that ensures attempts to commit files that are
# are larger than $limit to your _local_ repo fail, with a helpful error message.

# You can override the default limit of 2MB by supplying the environment variable:
# GIT_FILE_SIZE_LIMIT=2000000 git commit -m "test: this commit is allowed file sizes up to 50MB"
# GIT_FILE_SIZE_LIMIT=2000000 git commit -m "test: this commit is allowed file sizes up to 50MB"

	File $filename is $filesize MB, which is larger than github's maximum
        file size (2 MB). We will not be able to push this file to GitHub.
        The maximum file size allowed is 2MB.
